# PHP Arrays
An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of values in a single value. For example if you want to store 100 numbers then instead of defining 100 variables its easy to define an array of 100 length.
Array contains key & values.

There are three different kind of arrays.
- Numeric array − An array with a numeric index. Values are stored and accessed in linear fashion.
- Associative array − An array with strings as index. This stores element values in association with key values rather than in a strict linear index order.
- Multidimensional array − An array containing one or more arrays and values are accessed using multiple indices


## Numeric Array
These arrays can store numbers, strings and any object but their index will be represented by numbers. By default array index starts from zero.
We will see an example of how to create a numeric array.

## Associative Arrays
The associative arrays are very similar to numeric arrays in term of functionality but they are different in terms of their index. Associative array will have their index as string so that you can establish a strong association between key and values.
We will see an example to know more about associative array.


## Multidimensional Arrays
A multi-dimensional array of each element in the main array can also be an array. And each element in the sub-array can be an array, and so on. Values in the multi-dimensional array are accessed using multiple index.
### Example
In this example we create a two dimensional array to store marks of three students in three subjects −
This example is an associative array, you can create numeric array in the same fashion.
